## Objectives  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to create a light-weight gallery website for a potential client.
Toward that goal, i will:  
  - Create a 3-page website served with rendered view engine templates.  
  - Fetch a list of gallery items using fetch().  
  - Serve a JSON GET /api/v0/gallery endpoint using app.get() and a custom module.  

## Comments  
I REALLY enjoyed putting this one together to be honest. It felt nice combining most of what we learnt in the frontend portion of the course with the backend portion.
